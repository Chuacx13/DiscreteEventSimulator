# DiscreteEventSimulator

Developed a Discrete Event Simulator to manage customer **(Customer Class)** scheduling for both staffed service points **(Server Class)** and self-service kiosks **(SelfCheckOut Class)**, taking into account variable service durations, customers' arrival time and random probability of servers taking a break.

Sample test files has been included in the folder _Test-Cases_. 

**Test File Structure**:  
(Number of Servers) (Number of Self Check-Out Kiosks) (Max length of queue) (Probability of servers taking a break)  
(Customer's Arrival Time)

The main code can be found in the folder _Discrete Event Simulator_.
